in any society

food is at the center of social life and

even cultural identity because imagine

japan without sushi italy without pizza

mexico without tacos

each country has its own unique food and

without it it wouldn't be the same

so what better way to get to know the

romans than to take a closer look at

their food

nowadays italian food is probably the

most well-known and appreciated food in

the entire world and it generally

revolves around two things pasta and

tomatoes

but forget about that because pasta as

we know it today was not known to the

ancient romans as with tomatoes and all

of these other products most of them

come from south america and only enter

the european kitchens a thousand years

after the romans

so what did the romans eat then if it

wasn't tomato sauce pasta and pizza

when we think of culinary habits

nowadays each nation has a staple cheap

carbohydrate filler mostly either rice

potatoes or pasta

as we said potatoes were not yet known

rice was rare and had to be imported

from india and the only ancient pasta we

know of is best described as some sort

of small round lasagna sheets

this does resemble modern day pasta but

it seems it was highly in common

something else had to make up the core

of the roman diet and that something was

called frumentum meaning cereals

either pure or made into bread but

before we dive into the world of roman

cereals a quick word for our sponsor

endl

much more so than in roman times

nowadays we live in an increasingly

distracting environment with all sorts

of impulses coming in all the time and

this affects us mentally and physically

endo is a non-profit app that helps

people deal with this by creating

personalized soothing soundscapes

these soundscapes adapt in real time to

personal inputs like location weather

and heart rate

listening to endl improves your

concentration boosts productivity

reduces stress levels and relieves brain

fatigue

these soundscapes give your mind and

body what it needs to achieve total

immersion in any task whether you need

to focus relax or sleep

specifically for falling asleep andal

just released a new soundscape made in

cooperation with james blake called wind

down

we mostly use the app to help us focus

when writing scripts

and it has proven to be real effective

for us

no surprise as the work of endo is

backed by neuroscience

a telling way in which grain is shown to

be the cornerstone of the roman diet

were the three grain handouts in rome

installed already in the second century

bc in the time of the republic

hundreds of thousands of the poorer

citizens of rome received a monthly free

ration of grain amounting to some 35

kilos enough for a month of bread for

two persons

this was one of the first and for the

time most impactful forms of a social

safety net

it was a way to keep the population of

the capital fed and in that way help

combat hunger poverty corruption crime

and unrest in general

it was broadly accepted as essential for

the survival of rome and lasted until

the fall of the empire

in later times it was replaced by bread

giving us the phrase bread and games

but before that what did all these

people do with their grain

well one of the most common dishes in

ancient rome was a porridge called pools

the most traditional version amounts to

nothing more than ammer wheat boiled in

some salted water until soft and edible

to fasten the boiling process it'd be

smart to soak the grain overnight first

but even then the boiling takes roughly

an hour

so it's not exactly the fastest dish

it is easy to make though and nutritious

and cheap

from a price per calorie point of view

this is the absolute best poor man's

meal

on top of that it's highly versatile it

could be eaten warm or cold as breakfast

lunch or dinner as a side dish or a main

dish it really was the staple of the

roman diet especially for the poorer

romans

we can imagine poor people making this

in large quantities at a time to save on

firewood and eating the bets spread out

over multiple days

the only downside to this dish really is

the blend taste its entire need of some

flavor

no surprise there were many varieties of

which a handful of recipes survive

for example we know of one type of pools

that was made into a nicely balanced one

pot meal with onions beans and pork

added to it

another one was made with a base of

roasted barley then mixed with cumin

flaxseed and millet which was ground to

a fine powder before cooking it into a

thick sturdy porridge much like polenta

a sort of potato mesh like substance

made of ground corn flour still eaten

today in italy

and there was even a sweet one for

dessert with soft cheese and honey added

in and these are just some recipes that

survived after 2000 years

such types of grain porridge can be seen

as the substitutes of potatoes rice or

pasta

combined with the available ingredients

at the time there must have been an

endless variety of dishes with each

region and each family having their own

recipes and methods of preparation

but even then like nowadays you just

want something different now and then

was there something else to add to your

meal for some cheap calories

yes of course another option was to make

bread out of grain

bread provided some nice variation to

the grain porridges so bread was eaten a

lot

alongside meals at whatever moment of

the day

the most fascinating evidence for the

popularity of bread is a written

overview of eight days worth of shopping

uncovered on a wall in a house in the

ancient buried town of pompei

the list is a countdown of eight

consecutive days towards the ides the

middle of the month with a shopping list

for each of the days

it tells us this family's diet consisted

mainly of bread porridge cheese fruits

vegetables nuts and of course olives

olive oil and wine

interestingly enough bread is part of

all eight of the lists and consistently

put as the first item on the lists

you can say quite literally this

family's diet started with bread then

came the rest

they ate bread every day and bought it

fresh every day too

exceptions aside this was likely the

case for all the well-off families

being able to replace the cheaper poles

for bread more often

plautus a famous roman playwright

sometimes described characters in his

place as pulse eaters

this was meant in a condescending

derogatory way as to say these were

lowly simple people eating just a bland

mush

and when you think about it

porridge still kind of has an image of

being old-fashioned cheap and boring

certainly not something to serve your

guests

but also the poorer families who relied

on the free grain handouts would not be

solely reliant on porridge as they could

take a portion of their grain handout

and bring it to the baker so that he

could make it into bread for a small

price of course

or they could choose to buy the cheapest

bread because there were many types of

bread each with its own price

the shopping list alone mentioned no

less than three types of bread

just bread

coarse bread and bread for a slave

these clearly indicate different

qualities showing us that bread was

available for all layers of society

in general you know white bread was the

most beloved and most expensive

white bread was the most expensive

because it was made of the finest flour

in general the darker the bread the

coarser and cheaper

here you go lady one bread for you thank

you

thank you very much have a nice day

until next time

the most famous roman bread was the

so-called panis cuaratus

so-called because of four cuts or

impressions across the bread dividing it

into eight easily breakable pieces

this kind of bread is not famous because

of

the resemblance with pizza with the

different parts

but because we know exactly what it

looked like

not just because of its depictions on

wall paintings but more so because 80

such loaves have been found inside an

oven in pompeii carbonized and black but

still giving us this real-life tangible

ancient bread 2000 years later it's an

extremely rare and clear window into the

past

the abundance of depictions and mentions

of the bread suggests that this was the

most common bread available at least in

pompeii

next to the regular loaves there are all

sorts of specialist breads breads with a

specific purpose or characteristic

lenticulum for example was a flat and

round loaf tracta was more like a dry

cracker artologanus was a fatty cake

bread made with milk and lard

spoil stickers was a hurry bread

oyster bread to be eaten specifically

with oysters

or light and soft parthian bread

water bread light and full of holes like

a sponge excellent for dipping in wine

or olive oil sacrifice of breads for the

gods

big cannon a bread with nuts and honey

the list goes on and on

it is clear the romans cared for their

daily bread

and as much demand as there was so much

offer was there to meet it

bread could be bought the local bakery

itself

or it stands throughout the city for

example at the market or it stands next

to a temple selling sacrifice or bread

but for the real busy people bread could

even be delivered at home

the cheapest and most basic meal would

be to dip the bread in some wine it's a

good way to make all bread soft again

and make it easy to eat it quickly a

good way to have quick breakfast or an

easy meal on the road when there is no

fresh bread available

a similar meal is to dip your bread in

olive oil to add some extra flavor you

can add some salt garlic or green herbs

to the olive oil simple but tasty and

quite rich in calories and even

healthier than you might think because

olive oil contains lots of good fats and

antioxidants

studies have proven that eating olive

oil helps against the inflammations and

decreases the chance of heart diseases

strokes alzheimer and even cancer

then a step up in culinary complexity

would be to make a dipping sauce or

spread for bread

besides a pen the most important food

processing tool in any roman kitchen was

a mortarium

a heavy earthen bowl with its internal

surface embedded with coarse sand or

grit

like a mixing bowl and the grate in one

it was used to make all sorts of

delicacies of which the most well-known

is called muretum

a general term used for spreads and dips

usually based on the cheese combined

with ground and garlic and or herbs like

a modern day pesto or cheese spread

ideal for eating with bread and making

even the most boring bread delicious

and there are many cheeses to choose

from in antiquity as romans love cheese

cheeses were made from sheep goat and

cow's milk but the romans had a clear

preference for sheep and goat probably

because it's usually stronger in taste

the romans knew both fresh soft cheeses

like ricotta or cottage cheese as well

as aged heart cheeses and everything in

between

they even had a special smoked cheese

famously made in one specific

neighborhood in ancient rome

for many ordinary romans often times

cheese must have been the most tasteful

and expensive thing on the dinner table

but well worth it when considering the

golden combination it makes with red

wine bread and olive oil it turns an

ordinary meal into a real treat

then of course there are the things that

make our modern day dinner into dinner

vegetables and meats often cooked and

warm but the vegetables sometimes raw in

the form of salads

for the romans this was no different

lettuce rockets watercress the green

leaves of beets and many other smaller

plants were all eaten raw in the form of

salads

often vinegar and salt was added as a

dressing to the salad

the latin word for salt so is actually

where a word salad is derived from

as a more filling but healthy and cheap

side dish beans were perfect

most common and popular beans were

lentils chickpeas regular peas and broad

beans

with some roman culinary imagination

this could be made surprisingly tasty

such as a dish that is roughly

translated as fava beans a la vitellis

named after the gluttonous roman emperor

vitellius it's made of meshed broad

beans and egg yolks with an interesting

dressing of wine vinegar honey and

ginger

apart from beans the romans had many

other more green vegetables to choose

from as well some of the most popular

were broccoli cabbage leek asparagus and

celery to name just a few

but exotic items in itself weren't

uncommon either

because of the sheer size of the empire

and the relative safety of trade routes

economy blossomed like never before

resulting in more and more ingredients

entering the roman kitchens for example

black pepper produced in india has been

found in native homesteads all the way

in northwestern germania

products came from everywhere

olive oil and fish sauce from spain

wheat from north africa and egypt

cows from germania

cloves in nutmeg from india and beyond

next to importing new products the

romans also started the cultivation of

many products new to the local

population for example in germania there

were no plums apples peaches cherries

and walnuts until the romans arrived

the local population learned from the

romans how to grow these products

greatly increasing the variety of their

diet

finally

most expensive were fish and meat

when it comes to meat the romans had a

strong preference for pork

other livestock like chickens cows oxen

sheep and goats were held particularly

for the secondary products eggs traction

milk and wool

pigs don't offer any such secondary

products and were held purely for meat

purposes

their meat was therefore the most

expensive and maybe in part for that

reason the most craved

another likely reason for the liking of

pork is that it is the most fatty meat

and fat was considered nutritious and

therefore good the most popular ways to

eat meat was in the form of a stew or as

a sausage stuffed with minced meat and

mixed with spices and herbs

boiled meat was seen as less refined

then there's fish

fish came roughly in two varieties fresh

fish and preserved fish generally

speaking preserved salted fish would be

affordable for the common man as well

but fresh fish could cost anything

between a lot and a fortune especially

the rare and unusually big fish were

much sought after and being bought for

ridiculous prices

but they would not be for regular

day-to-day consumption though these fish

were clearly meant to impress important

guests

as food was one of the prime ways to

display your power in ancient rome so

the bigger rarer and more exotic the

better

it is only for this reason that we know

recipes of flamingos tongue sea urchins

camel's feet and giraffe meat

but this is the stuff of rome's ultimate

elite and hardly realistic even for them

this concludes our overview of the diet

of an ancient roman from poor to rich

thanks to the size and the vast trade

network of the empire

many products were available and cheap

it would take many centuries after the

roman empire before the common man had

access to such a varied diet again

well this concludes our video we hope

you enjoyed it and now it's time to do

the dishes
