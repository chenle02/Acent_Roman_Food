1
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,160
in any society

2
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,720
food is at the center of social life and

3
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,840
even cultural identity because imagine

4
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,919
japan without sushi italy without pizza

5
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,320
mexico without tacos

6
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,719
each country has its own unique food and

7
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,880
without it it wouldn't be the same

8
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,200
so what better way to get to know the

9
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,760
romans than to take a closer look at

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,760
their food

11
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,079
nowadays italian food is probably the

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,160
most well-known and appreciated food in

13
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,559
the entire world and it generally

14
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,839
revolves around two things pasta and

15
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,160
tomatoes

16
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,000
but forget about that because pasta as

17
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,559
we know it today was not known to the

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,879
ancient romans as with tomatoes and all

19
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:01,039
of these other products most of them

20
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:03,199
come from south america and only enter

21
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:06,000
the european kitchens a thousand years

22
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,000
after the romans

23
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,799
so what did the romans eat then if it

24
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,560
wasn't tomato sauce pasta and pizza

25
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:17,600
when we think of culinary habits

26
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,479
nowadays each nation has a staple cheap

27
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,320
carbohydrate filler mostly either rice

28
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,880
potatoes or pasta

29
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,798
as we said potatoes were not yet known

30
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,039
rice was rare and had to be imported

31
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:31,040
from india and the only ancient pasta we

32
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,920
know of is best described as some sort

33
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,479
of small round lasagna sheets

34
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,880
this does resemble modern day pasta but

35
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,479
it seems it was highly in common

36
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,880
something else had to make up the core

37
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:46,240
of the roman diet and that something was

38
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:48,960
called frumentum meaning cereals

39
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,960
either pure or made into bread but

40
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,439
before we dive into the world of roman

41
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,640
cereals a quick word for our sponsor

42
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,559
endl

43
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,479
much more so than in roman times

44
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,799
nowadays we live in an increasingly

45
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:03,439
distracting environment with all sorts

46
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:06,719
of impulses coming in all the time and

47
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:08,959
this affects us mentally and physically

48
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:11,038
endo is a non-profit app that helps

49
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,760
people deal with this by creating

50
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:16,079
personalized soothing soundscapes

51
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,640
these soundscapes adapt in real time to

52
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,160
personal inputs like location weather

53
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,760
and heart rate

54
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,319
listening to endl improves your

55
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,560
concentration boosts productivity

56
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,760
reduces stress levels and relieves brain

57
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,360
fatigue

58
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,359
these soundscapes give your mind and

59
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,680
body what it needs to achieve total

60
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,720
immersion in any task whether you need

61
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,959
to focus relax or sleep

62
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,120
specifically for falling asleep andal

63
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,840
just released a new soundscape made in

64
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,879
cooperation with james blake called wind

65
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,200
down

66
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,799
we mostly use the app to help us focus

67
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,640
when writing scripts

68
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,920
and it has proven to be real effective

69
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,238
for us

70
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,160
no surprise as the work of endo is

71
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,840

a telling way in which grain is shown to

76
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,440
be the cornerstone of the roman diet

77
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,280
were the three grain handouts in rome

78
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,680
installed already in the second century

79
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,440
bc in the time of the republic

80
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,000
hundreds of thousands of the poorer

81
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,879
citizens of rome received a monthly free

82
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,280
ration of grain amounting to some 35

83
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,720
kilos enough for a month of bread for

84
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,799
two persons

85
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,760
this was one of the first and for the

86
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,959
time most impactful forms of a social

87
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,798
safety net

88
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,040
it was a way to keep the population of

89
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:40,159
the capital fed and in that way help

90
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,079
combat hunger poverty corruption crime

91
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:44,239
and unrest in general

92
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,480
it was broadly accepted as essential for

93
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,400
the survival of rome and lasted until

94
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,359
the fall of the empire

95
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:54,159
in later times it was replaced by bread

96
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,920
giving us the phrase bread and games

97
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:59,040
but before that what did all these

98
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:01,200
people do with their grain

99
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,560
well one of the most common dishes in

100
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,480
ancient rome was a porridge called pools

101
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,959
the most traditional version amounts to

102
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:12,079
nothing more than ammer wheat boiled in

103
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,840
some salted water until soft and edible

104
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,239
to fasten the boiling process it'd be

105
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,320
smart to soak the grain overnight first

106
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,358
but even then the boiling takes roughly

107
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,000
an hour

108
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:24,400
so it's not exactly the fastest dish

109
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,600
it is easy to make though and nutritious

110
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,000
and cheap

111
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,000
from a price per calorie point of view

112
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,120
this is the absolute best poor man's

113
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,680
meal

114
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,639
on top of that it's highly versatile it

115
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,520
could be eaten warm or cold as breakfast

116
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:41,840
lunch or dinner as a side dish or a main

117
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,159
dish it really was the staple of the

118
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,400
roman diet especially for the poorer

119
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,639
romans

120
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,960
we can imagine poor people making this

121
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,520
in large quantities at a time to save on

122
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,120
firewood and eating the bets spread out

123
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,680
over multiple days

124
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,840
the only downside to this dish really is

125
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,919
the blend taste its entire need of some

126
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,239
flavor

127
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:06,639
no surprise there were many varieties of

128
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,960
which a handful of recipes survive

129
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,360
for example we know of one type of pools

130
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:14,320
that was made into a nicely balanced one

131
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,680
pot meal with onions beans and pork

132
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,360
added to it

133
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,160
another one was made with a base of

134
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,880
roasted barley then mixed with cumin

135
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,120
flaxseed and millet which was ground to

136
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:28,240
a fine powder before cooking it into a

137
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,880
thick sturdy porridge much like polenta

138
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,440
a sort of potato mesh like substance

139
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,960
made of ground corn flour still eaten

140
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,479
today in italy

141
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,880
and there was even a sweet one for

142
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:41,360
dessert with soft cheese and honey added

143
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:44,560
in and these are just some recipes that

144
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,639
survived after 2000 years

145
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,280
such types of grain porridge can be seen

146
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,320
as the substitutes of potatoes rice or

147
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,159
pasta

148
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,680
combined with the available ingredients

149
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,000
at the time there must have been an

150
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,000
endless variety of dishes with each

151
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,560
region and each family having their own

152
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,960
recipes and methods of preparation

153
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,960
but even then like nowadays you just

154
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,638
want something different now and then

155
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:10,000
was there something else to add to your

156
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,000
meal for some cheap calories

157
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,880
yes of course another option was to make

158
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,960
bread out of grain

159
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,600
bread provided some nice variation to

160
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,400
the grain porridges so bread was eaten a

161
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,319
lot

162
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,359
alongside meals at whatever moment of

163
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,039
the day

164
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,199
the most fascinating evidence for the

165
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:30,080
popularity of bread is a written

166
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:32,080
overview of eight days worth of shopping

167
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,639
uncovered on a wall in a house in the

168
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,318
ancient buried town of pompei

169
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,800
the list is a countdown of eight

170
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:41,039
consecutive days towards the ides the

171
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,720
middle of the month with a shopping list

172
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:45,199
for each of the days

173
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:48,319
it tells us this family's diet consisted

174
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:51,280
mainly of bread porridge cheese fruits

175
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:53,280
vegetables nuts and of course olives

176
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,758
olive oil and wine

177
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:58,239
interestingly enough bread is part of

178
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,800
all eight of the lists and consistently

179
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,880
put as the first item on the lists

180
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,199
you can say quite literally this

181
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,919
family's diet started with bread then

182
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,919
came the rest

183
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:12,400
they ate bread every day and bought it

184
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,560
fresh every day too

185
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:17,280
exceptions aside this was likely the

186
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,199
case for all the well-off families

187
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,039
being able to replace the cheaper poles

188
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,759
for bread more often

189
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:25,520
plautus a famous roman playwright

190
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,680
sometimes described characters in his

191
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,440
place as pulse eaters

192
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,160
this was meant in a condescending

193
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,560
derogatory way as to say these were

194
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,440
lowly simple people eating just a bland

195
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,120
mush

196
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,039
and when you think about it

197
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,680
porridge still kind of has an image of

198
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:43,120
being old-fashioned cheap and boring

199
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,840
certainly not something to serve your

200
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,840
guests

201
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,960
but also the poorer families who relied

202
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,599
on the free grain handouts would not be

203
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,440
solely reliant on porridge as they could

204
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,199
take a portion of their grain handout

205
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,360
and bring it to the baker so that he

206
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,720
could make it into bread for a small

207
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,400
price of course

208
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,400
or they could choose to buy the cheapest

209
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,120
bread because there were many types of

210
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,198
bread each with its own price

211
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,199
the shopping list alone mentioned no

212
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,560
less than three types of bread

213
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,360
just bread

214
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,800
coarse bread and bread for a slave

215
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,960
these clearly indicate different

216
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,919
qualities showing us that bread was

217
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:24,239
available for all layers of society

218
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:26,960
in general you know white bread was the

219
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,720
most beloved and most expensive

220
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,359
white bread was the most expensive

221
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,519
because it was made of the finest flour

222
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,800
in general the darker the bread the

223
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,799
coarser and cheaper

224
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,679
here you go lady one bread for you thank

225
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,199
you

226
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,838
thank you very much have a nice day

227
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,000
until next time

228
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,320
the most famous roman bread was the

229
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,320
so-called panis cuaratus

230
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,200
so-called because of four cuts or

231
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,839
impressions across the bread dividing it

232
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,920
into eight easily breakable pieces

233
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,560
this kind of bread is not famous because

234
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,560
of

235
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,920
the resemblance with pizza with the

236
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,160
different parts

237
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,199
but because we know exactly what it

238
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,880
looked like

239
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,760
not just because of its depictions on

240
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,680
wall paintings but more so because 80

241
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,800
such loaves have been found inside an

242
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:17,599
oven in pompeii carbonized and black but

243
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:20,479
still giving us this real-life tangible

244
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,480
ancient bread 2000 years later it's an

245
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,519
extremely rare and clear window into the

246
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,600
past

247
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,760
the abundance of depictions and mentions

248
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,839
of the bread suggests that this was the

249
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:32,319
most common bread available at least in

250
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,320
pompeii

251
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,839
next to the regular loaves there are all

252
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,399
sorts of specialist breads breads with a

253
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:42,959
specific purpose or characteristic

254
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:45,519
lenticulum for example was a flat and

255
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:48,479
round loaf tracta was more like a dry

256
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,560
cracker artologanus was a fatty cake

257
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,880
bread made with milk and lard

258
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,959
spoil stickers was a hurry bread

259
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,240
oyster bread to be eaten specifically

260
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,719
with oysters

261
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,040
or light and soft parthian bread

262
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,120
water bread light and full of holes like

263
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,760
a sponge excellent for dipping in wine

264
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,720
or olive oil sacrifice of breads for the

265
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,120
gods

266
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:12,079
big cannon a bread with nuts and honey

267
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,760
the list goes on and on

268
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,120
it is clear the romans cared for their

269
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,439
daily bread

270
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,600
and as much demand as there was so much

271
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,440
offer was there to meet it

272
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,399
bread could be bought the local bakery

273
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,880
itself

274
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:27,680
or it stands throughout the city for

275
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:30,399
example at the market or it stands next

276
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,959
to a temple selling sacrifice or bread

277
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:36,640
but for the real busy people bread could

278
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,640
even be delivered at home

279
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,480
the cheapest and most basic meal would

280
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,480
be to dip the bread in some wine it's a

281
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,720
good way to make all bread soft again

282
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,640
and make it easy to eat it quickly a

283
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,560
good way to have quick breakfast or an

284
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:53,600
easy meal on the road when there is no

285
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,599
fresh bread available

286
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,320
a similar meal is to dip your bread in

287
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:00,560
olive oil to add some extra flavor you

288
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,360
can add some salt garlic or green herbs

289
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:05,199
to the olive oil simple but tasty and

290
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,959
quite rich in calories and even

291
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,040
healthier than you might think because

292
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,560
olive oil contains lots of good fats and

293
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,480
antioxidants

294
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,640
studies have proven that eating olive

295
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,959
oil helps against the inflammations and

296
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:21,120
decreases the chance of heart diseases

297
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:21,119
strokes alzheimer and even cancer

298
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,519
then a step up in culinary complexity

299
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,120
would be to make a dipping sauce or

300
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,440
spread for bread

301
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,760
besides a pen the most important food

302
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,279
processing tool in any roman kitchen was

303
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,600
a mortarium

304
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:37,600
a heavy earthen bowl with its internal

305
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,480
surface embedded with coarse sand or

306
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,279
grit

307
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,720
like a mixing bowl and the grate in one

308
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:45,040
it was used to make all sorts of

309
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,480
delicacies of which the most well-known

310
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,040
is called muretum

311
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,959
a general term used for spreads and dips

312
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,360
usually based on the cheese combined

313
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:55,760
with ground and garlic and or herbs like

314
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,839
a modern day pesto or cheese spread

315
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:01,360
ideal for eating with bread and making

316
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,959
even the most boring bread delicious

317
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,320
and there are many cheeses to choose

318
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:08,479
from in antiquity as romans love cheese

319
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,720
cheeses were made from sheep goat and

320
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:13,120
cow's milk but the romans had a clear

321
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,760
preference for sheep and goat probably

322
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:18,880
because it's usually stronger in taste

323
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:21,279
the romans knew both fresh soft cheeses

324
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,680
like ricotta or cottage cheese as well

325
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,800
as aged heart cheeses and everything in

326
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,439
between

327
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,040
they even had a special smoked cheese

328
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,040
famously made in one specific

329
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,439
neighborhood in ancient rome

330
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,279
for many ordinary romans often times

331
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,600
cheese must have been the most tasteful

332
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:39,680
and expensive thing on the dinner table

333
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,519
but well worth it when considering the

334
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,000
golden combination it makes with red

335
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:47,760
wine bread and olive oil it turns an

336
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,760
ordinary meal into a real treat

337
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:51,839
then of course there are the things that

338
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:54,399
make our modern day dinner into dinner

339
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:56,480
vegetables and meats often cooked and

340
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,000
warm but the vegetables sometimes raw in

341
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,000
the form of salads

342
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,399
for the romans this was no different

343
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,240
lettuce rockets watercress the green

344
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,480
leaves of beets and many other smaller

345
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,600
plants were all eaten raw in the form of

346
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,519
salads

347
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,120
often vinegar and salt was added as a

348
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,920
dressing to the salad

349
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:16,320
the latin word for salt so is actually

350
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,560
where a word salad is derived from

351
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,880
as a more filling but healthy and cheap

352
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,959
side dish beans were perfect

353
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,839
most common and popular beans were

354
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:28,079
lentils chickpeas regular peas and broad

355
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:30,720
beans

356
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:32,959
with some roman culinary imagination

357
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,880
this could be made surprisingly tasty

358
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:38,000
such as a dish that is roughly

359
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,839
translated as fava beans a la vitellis

360
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,160
named after the gluttonous roman emperor

361
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:44,480
vitellius it's made of meshed broad

362
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,839
beans and egg yolks with an interesting

363
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,560
dressing of wine vinegar honey and

364
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:50,639
ginger

365
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,560
apart from beans the romans had many

366
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,880
other more green vegetables to choose

367
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:58,000
from as well some of the most popular

368
00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:02,160
were broccoli cabbage leek asparagus and

369
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,560
celery to name just a few

370
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,000
but exotic items in itself weren't

371
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,920
uncommon either

372
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
because of the sheer size of the empire

373
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,160
and the relative safety of trade routes

374
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,160
economy blossomed like never before

375
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:17,279
resulting in more and more ingredients

376
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:19,680
entering the roman kitchens for example

377
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:21,760
black pepper produced in india has been

378
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:24,000
found in native homesteads all the way

379
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:26,079
in northwestern germania

380
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,880
products came from everywhere

381
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:31,599
olive oil and fish sauce from spain

382
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,600
wheat from north africa and egypt

383
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:37,040
cows from germania

384
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,959
cloves in nutmeg from india and beyond

385
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,880
next to importing new products the

386
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:42,839
romans also started the cultivation of

387
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:46,079
many products new to the local

388
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:48,800
population for example in germania there

389
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:51,439
were no plums apples peaches cherries

390
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,120
and walnuts until the romans arrived

391
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,040
the local population learned from the

392
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,880
romans how to grow these products

393
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,480
greatly increasing the variety of their

394
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,600
diet

395
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,639
finally

396
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,639
most expensive were fish and meat

397
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:07,279
when it comes to meat the romans had a

398
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:10,399
strong preference for pork

399
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:12,480
other livestock like chickens cows oxen

400
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:15,199
sheep and goats were held particularly

401
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,720
for the secondary products eggs traction

402
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,639
milk and wool

403
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,639
pigs don't offer any such secondary

404
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,760
products and were held purely for meat

405
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,199
purposes

406
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:26,240
their meat was therefore the most

407
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:28,160
expensive and maybe in part for that

408
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,000
reason the most craved

409
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,240
another likely reason for the liking of

410
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,160
pork is that it is the most fatty meat

411
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,800
and fat was considered nutritious and

412
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:39,360
therefore good the most popular ways to

413
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,839
eat meat was in the form of a stew or as

414
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,160
a sausage stuffed with minced meat and

415
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:48,240
mixed with spices and herbs

416
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,240
boiled meat was seen as less refined

417
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:53,439
then there's fish

418
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:55,920
fish came roughly in two varieties fresh

419
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:58,800
fish and preserved fish generally

420
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:01,120
speaking preserved salted fish would be

421
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,040
affordable for the common man as well

422
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,759
but fresh fish could cost anything

423
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:08,160
between a lot and a fortune especially

424
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:10,000
the rare and unusually big fish were

425
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,759
much sought after and being bought for

426
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,360
ridiculous prices

427
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,759
but they would not be for regular

428
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,920
day-to-day consumption though these fish

429
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,120
were clearly meant to impress important

430
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,279
guests

431
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,839
as food was one of the prime ways to

432
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:26,320
display your power in ancient rome so

433
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,360
the bigger rarer and more exotic the

434
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,279
better

435
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:32,160
it is only for this reason that we know

436
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:34,560
recipes of flamingos tongue sea urchins

437
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,560
camel's feet and giraffe meat

438
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:41,040
but this is the stuff of rome's ultimate

439
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:43,359
elite and hardly realistic even for them

440
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:46,880
this concludes our overview of the diet

441
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:48,800
of an ancient roman from poor to rich

442
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,480
thanks to the size and the vast trade

443
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,199
network of the empire

444
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,120
many products were available and cheap

445
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:57,359
it would take many centuries after the

446
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:00,320
roman empire before the common man had

447
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,639
access to such a varied diet again

448
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:05,199
well this concludes our video we hope

449
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:08,359
you enjoyed it and now it's time to do

450
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,360
the dishes

451
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:28,128
